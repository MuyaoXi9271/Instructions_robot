2. Prepare the mixture of internal standards ready for making the final serials of points on calibration curve

3. If you would like to add additional solvent to the serials of solutions, please also prepare it in the GC vial

4. How many serials of concentrations and what they are in the calibration curve

5. Then apply the interface to make calibration curve as shown in the image
